We call this arrangement the “octaweb” – eight engines around the edge and one in the center. \n\nThe octaweb could be considered the backbone of the Falcon 9 – a massive metallic structure that holds the engines in place, each in their own separate bay. Its weight, combined with that of the nine Merlin engines, gives a landing first stage an extremely low center of gravity.\n\nThe octaweb structure is put together using a series of welds.

When attached to the ISS, this hardware will enable any type of spacecraft to deliver astronauts to the station, from US commercial spacecraft under development like our Crew Dragon, to future international spacecraft yet to be designed. Today, the docking adapter is being extracted from Dragon's trunk with the station's robotic arm. On Friday, NASA astronauts will conduct a spacewalk to install it.\n \nDragon is scheduled to return to Earth on August 26, carrying important scientific data and materials from the station. As the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth, we’re glad to be able to use Dragon’s unique capabilities to support the vital research work of the ISS - and to advance scientific knowledge for the entire world.","permalink_url":"https://www.facebook.com/SpaceX/posts/10157830713905131:0","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14034799_10157830713905131_1541530238086858789_n.jpg?oh=90e2e499b571164428d4694a35da3039&oe=586D561A","shares":{"count":748},"id":"353851465130_10157830713905131","likes":{"data":[],"summary":{"total_count":8374,"can_like":true,"has_liked":false}}},{"created_time":"2016-08-14T18:16:48+0000","full_picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13921131_10157817306510131_4834313840167370694_n.jpg?oh=4bf6281e342a9d70b79ed3bf19c65823&oe=5869C42D","link":"https://www.facebook.com/SpaceX/photos/a.10151395449565131.826076.353851465130/10157817306510131/?type=3","permalink_url":"https://www.facebook.com/SpaceX/posts/10157817306665131","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13921131_10157817306510131_4834313840167370694_n.jpg?oh=20e3fab9a4578509376d088cad8f20a6&oe=5871B420","shares":{"count":249},"id":"353851465130_10157817306665131","likes":{"data":[],"summary":{"total_count":9664,"can_like":true,"has_liked":false}}},{"created_time":"2016-08-14T06:22:51+0000","full_picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13912589_10157814978500131_6865040113236409671_n.jpg?oh=e9c32e320eaf40fb22cfda714e0e2ffb&oe=5862B1B4","link":"https://www.facebook.com/SpaceX/photos/a.10150303260090131.563831.353851465130/10157814978500131/?type=3","message":"Tonight, Falcon 9 delivered the JCSAT-16 spacecraft to a Geostationary Transfer Orbit approximately 36,000 km from Earth.
